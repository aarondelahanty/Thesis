%Background:
Microfluidic devices generally require precise control of fluid flowrates in order to reliably perform their various functions. Here a pressure-driven flow controller (PDFC) is developed and characterized for use as a flow provider for droplet-makers and as a tool for further microfluidics-based research. 

%Objectives:
The PDFC is first designed, manufactured and characterized prior to being applied to the study of droplet formation. Previously, droplet-makers that utilize volumetric flow control have been used to define the relationship between continuous and discontinuous phase flowrates and the resulting droplet parameters and flow regimes. Here, experimentation is conducted investigating the same droplet formation behavior but as observed in a system driven by pressure-based flow in a T-junction droplet generating device.

%Results:
The PDFC system was characterized to show pressure control ranging from 0 to 1000mbar with 4 discreetly controlled channels capable of $\pm 1$ mbar accuracy with a measured signal standard deviation of 0.25 mbar and signal to noise ratio of 400. The PDFC was then applied to microfluidic droplet production. Here, for the first time the transition from dripping to squeezing droplet formation regimes is experimentally documented in a pressure-driven flow system. The resulting droplets show high monodispersity with less than 1\% coefficient of variation in droplet length in all measured populations.
