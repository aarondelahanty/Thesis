\chapter{System Application - Droplet Microluidics}
\section{Aims}
The application of the PDFC to droplet microfluidics serves two purposes. First, it verifies that the system is functioning as intended for use as a research tool. Second, it allows the characterization of droplet formation by a pressure driven flow in conjunction with X and T-junction geometry, an area currently underdeveloped \cite{Christopher2008}. These aims can be fulfilled by the following two objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine how applied pressure determine droplet formation regime
\item Relate applied pressure to droplet scaling law \cite{Zhao2011}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Methods}
\subsection{Device Generation}
\begin{comment}
BELOW IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A BRIEF DEVICE GENERATION PROCEDURE:

"The microfluidic device is fabricated using conventional soft lithography methods.11 A
50 lm thick SU-8 photoresist was spin-coated onto a RCA-1 cleaned silicon wafer and patterned with UV light and a contact mask. Unpolymerized photoresist was removed during de- velopment using SU-8 developer. Poly (dimethyl siloxane), or PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corn- ing) was poured onto the SU-8 mold to form the fluidic channels. After cutting the devices off of the mold and punching connection holes, the devices were treated with oxygen plasma and bonded to a slab of PDMS. Flow was driven using digital pressure regulators (SMC Corpora- tion, Noblesville, IN, USA) with an output pressure range of 0.005-0.1 MPa, and controlled via a custom LabView interface" - \cite{Simon2012}
\end{comment}
\subsection{Experimental Procedure}

Droplet formation was captured on a high speed camera at 2.5k to 20k frames per second. The applied control pressure was held constant for the continuous phase at a nominal value of 40, 60 and 80 mbar while varying the discontinuous phase control pressure. Discontinuous phase control pressure was varied at intervals of $\approx$5mbar until droplet formation ceased due to the onset of backflow or instability, for low or high pressures, respectively. The captured images were then analyzed using a custom imageJ script to determine droplet length, $L$, and position, $X$, along an arbitrarily defined axis parallel to the geometry's outlet channel.
 
\section{Results}

For the T-junction channel geometry described the dimensionless droplet ratio of droplet length, $L$, over channel width, $W$, is plotted as a function of the applied control pressure ratios, $\frac{P_{H_2O}}{P_Oil}$, shown in Figure \vref{fig:lwvpr}. Error bars have been calculated by standard deviation of measured droplet length which results in error equal to or smaller than the symbol size and thus not shown.

\end{figure}

Outer Ca values are calculated given an interfacial tension of $\gamma = 2.87 \times 10^{-3}\frac{N}{m}$, continuous phase viscosity of $\mu = 1.24 \times 10^{-3} Pa \cdot s$\cite{3M2009}, and mean velocity, $u$, as determined by droplet position over consecutive frames as shown in Equation \vref{eq:velocity}.

\begin{equation}
[u] = \Big[\frac{pixels}{frames}\Big] \Big[\frac{frames}{sec}\Big] \Big[\frac{meters}{pixel}\Big] = \Big[\frac{meters}{sec}\Big]
\label{eq:velocity}
\end{equation}

Droplet length is plotted as a function of capillary number as shown in Figure \vref{fig:regimes2} for each of the applied continuous pressures. Images of droplet formation are shown within the squeezing and dripping regimes for each control pressure. The image shown was captured one frame prior to droplet formation.

\section{Discussion}

Previous work has been done to establish specific flow regimes in which droplets are formed in T-junction geometry by both numeric modeling and experimental investigations \cite{Abate2012a},\cite{DeMenech2008},\cite{Garstecki2006}. \emph{However, to the best of the author's knowledge there has been no record of experimental observations demonstrating the regime transition from squeezing to dripping in a pressure-driven flow system.} This, despite the fact that there have been documented dissimilarities in volumetric versus pressure-driven flow in droplet formation\cite{Ward2005}, and that there may be advantages in droplet monodispersity in pressure-driven systems \cite{Christopher2008}\cite{Li2014a}. 

Previous findings suggest that two stable droplet formation regimes exist in T-junction droplet formation, \emph{dripping} and \emph{squeezing}. In a highly cited paper, De Menech et al showed by numerical modeling that the transition between the two distinct droplet regimes may be defined by a Critical Capillary Number, $Ca_{cr}$, and that this transition is independent of viscosity ratio and flowrates, shown in Figure \vref{fig:menechtransition} \cite{DeMenech2008}. This transition has been previously determined both experimentally and in numerical simulations to be $Ca_{cr}\approx 10^{-2}$.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{menechtransition.PNG} 
\caption[Menech Regime Transition]{Used directly, without permision} 
\label{fig:menechtransition} 
\end{figure}

The data presented here shows a distinct transition between dripping and squeezing regimes, however, the $Ca_{cr}$ value at which the transition occurs is not universal between the different continuous phase pressures. The transitional capillary number can be plotted as a function of the continuous phase pressure as shown in Figure \vref{fig:CrCaABline}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.75\columnwidth]{CrCaABline.PNG} 
\caption[Critical capillary number as a function of continuous phase applied pressure]{Critical capillary number as a function of continuous phase applied pressure} 
\label{fig:CrCaABline} 
\end{figure}

In these experiments the same bulk reagents are used and therefore both interfacial tension and viscosities should remain constant across multiple trials. Here, the only variable affecting variability in the \emph{Ca} value is the mean velocity of the continuous phase, which in this case is approximated by direct measurement of the droplet velocity. It is expected that there is some numerical difference between the velocity of the droplets and the mean velocity of the continuous phase \cite{Ward2005}, which may account for the variability in critical capillary number.

A model of Poiseuille flow in a rectangular channel could be used to provide a more accurate determination of the mean continuous phase velocity (as a function of droplet velocity. Alternatively, due to the linear nature of relationship between applied control pressure of the continuous phase and the critical capillary number the velocities could be corrected such that the regime transition is coincident, as shown in Figure \vref{fig:ca_cor}.

\label{fig:ca_cor} 
\end{figure}

In the system developed here, the only inputs used to manipulate flow behavior are the two applied pressures. Therefore, in order to characterize the system's flow regimes it is logical to determine the relationship between applied pressures and the resulting droplet velocity. Here, velocity is plotted as a function of the applied pressure ratio for both T and X-junctions as shown in Figure \vref{fig:vel_pr}.  Ward determined the relationship for their system as shown in Figure \vref{fig:wardVelocity}. (XX we need to do the same)

Two important observations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The system used here is operating at velocities approximately a magnitude greater than Ward's system (1m/s vs 1cm/s)
\item The relationship between velocity and applied pressure ratios are different. Our system shows a relatively linear and slightly downward trending velocity while in Ward's case velocity is relatively flat then at some critical pressure increases exponentially.
\end{enumerate}


From the droplet velocity Ca and Re values can be determined. Again, Ca is considerably higher than reported by others \cite{DeMenech2008}, \cite{Ward2005} . A plot of droplet length versus Ca value is shown in Figure \vref{fig:ca_pr}.

Using the determined velocities Ca and Re numbers are calculated as shown in Figure \vref{ReCa_calc}

In order to qualitatively characterize the formation of droplets across the entire range of functional pressure ratios, the following section will describe the system behavior at the states of no-flow, dripping, squeezing, and jetting. Due to the strong similarities in droplet-formation behavior between the X-junction and T-junction geometry they will be discussed in general terms with specific metrics given for each case.



\paragraph{No-Flow}
As the system is moved towards the lowest operational pressure ratios, the aqueous phase comes to a a quasi equilibrium no-flow state. As previously reported by Ward et al cite{Ward2005} . If the pressure ratio is decreased any further(either by increasing $P_{Oil}$ or decreasing $P_{H_2O}$) back-flow will occur, in which the continuous phase begins displacing the aqueous phase upstream towards the reservoir. This quasi equilibrium state may be described as a balance of forces between the pressure of the two phases and the Laplace pressure differential across the liquid-liquid interface, described as shown in Equation \vref{eq:noflow}.

\begin{equation}
P_{H_2O*} + P_{Laplace} = P_{Oil*} 
\label{eq:noflow}
\end{equation}

Where Laplace pressure can be roughly approximated given $\gamma$ is the interfacial tension between the two phases, $r$ is the radius of curvature of the interface as:
\begin{equation}
 P_{Laplace} = \frac{2 \gamma}{r}
\label{eq:laplace}
\end{equation}

It should be noted that here $P_{H_2O*}$ and $P_{Oil*}$ represent the pressures of the two phases local to the X or T junction and that there is some unknown pressure drop between the applied control pressures at the inlet reservoirs and these local pressures. This pressure drop is dependent on device geometry as well as solution viscosity and can be determined by Hagan-Poiseuille approximations (XX - needs to be done). 
 
\paragraph{Dripping}

As the control pressure applied to the discontinuous phase is increased beyond the \emph{no-flow} state the immiscible thread begins to extend into the device's channel junction. 


\paragraph{Squeezing}

The pinch point moving further downstream is a manifestation of the increases in tangental viscous forces relative to inertial forces (Ca). The Ca value increases due to the increase in velocity as the interfacial tension and viscosity are both constant. The viscous forces acting tangentially to the discontinuous phase boundary elongates the immiscible thread before the combined effect of increased plugging pressure and inertial forces finally dominate leading to droplet formation.

"In microfluidic droplet formation, capillary numbers typically
range from Ca ~ $10^{-3}$ to $10^1$ for flow rates accessible using syringe pumps."\cite{Christopher2007}
