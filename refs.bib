abstract = {This critical review discusses the current understanding of the formation, transport, and merging of drops in microfluidics. We focus on the physical ingredients which determine the flow of drops in microchannels and recall classical results of fluid dynamics which help explain the observed behaviour. We begin by introducing the main physical ingredients that differentiate droplet microfluidics from single-phase microfluidics, namely the modifications to the flow and pressure fields that are introduced by the presence of interfacial tension. Then three practical aspects are studied in detail: (i) The formation of drops and the dominant interactions depending on the geometry in which they are formed. (ii) The transport of drops, namely the evaluation of drop velocity, the pressure-velocity relationships, and the flow field induced by the presence of the drop. (iii) The fusion of two drops, including different methods of bridging the liquid film between them which enables their merging.},

@book{Bruus2008,
abstract = {Microfluidics is a young and rapidly expanding scientific discipline, which deals with fluids and solutions in miniaturized systems, the so-called lab-on-a-chip systems. It has applications in chemical engineering, pharmaceutics, biotechnology and medicine. As the lab-on-a-chip systems grow in complexity, a proper theoretical understanding becomes increasingly important. The basic idea of the book is to provide a self-contained formulation of the theoretical framework of microfluidics, and at the same time give physical motivation and examples from lab-on-a-chip technology. After three chapters introducing microfluidics, the governing equations for mass, momentum and energy, and some basic flow solutions, the following 14 chapters treat hydraulic time-dependent flow, capillarity, electro- and magneto-hydrodynamics, thermal transport, two-phase flow, complex flow patterns and acousto-fluidics, as well as the new fields of opto- and nano-fluidics. Throughout the book simple models with analytical solutions are presented to provide the student with a thorough physical understanding of order of magnitudes and various selected microfluidic phenomena and devices. The book grew out of a set of well-tested lecture notes. It is with its many pedagogical exercises designed as a textbook for an advanced undergraduate or first-year graduate course. It is also well suited for self-study.},

abstract = {Micromixing is a crucial process within microfluidic systems such as micro total analysis systems ($\mu$TAS). A state-of-art review on microstructured mixing devices and their mixing phenomena is given. The review first presents an overview of the characteristics of fluidic behavior at the microscale and their implications in microfluidic mixing processes. According to the two basic principles exploited to induce mixing at the microscale, micromixers are generally classified as being passive or active. Passive mixers solely rely on pumping energy, whereas active mixers rely on an external energy source to achieve mixing. Typical types of passive micromixers are discussed, including T- or Y-shaped, parallel lamination, sequential, focusing enhanced mixers, and droplet micromixers. Examples of active mixers using external forces such as pressure field, electrokinetic, dielectrophoretic, electrowetting, magneto-hydrodynamic, and ultrasound to assist mixing are presented. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of mixing in a microfluidic environment are discussed.},

abstract = {An experimental study of droplet breakup in T-shaped microfluidic junctions is presented in which the capillary number and flow rate ratio are varied over a wide range for several different viscosity ratios and several different ratios of the inlet channel widths. The range of conditions corresponds to the region in which both the squeezing pressure that arises when the emerging interface obstructs the channel and the viscous shear stress on the emerging interface strongly influence the process. In this regime, the droplet volume depends on the capillary number, the flow rate ratio, and the ratio of inlet channel widths, which controls the degree of confinement of the droplets. The viscosity ratio influences the droplet volume only when the viscosities are similar. When there is a large viscosity contrast in which the dispersed-phase liquid is at least 50 times smaller than the continuous-phase liquid, the resulting size is independent of the viscosity ratio and no transition to a purely squeezing regime appears. In this case, both the droplet volume and the droplet production frequency obey power-law behavior with the capillary number, consistent with expectations based on mass conservation of the dispersed-phase liquid. Finally, scaling arguments are presented that result in predicted droplet volumes that depend on the capillary number, flow rate ratio, and width ratio in a qualitatively similar way to that observed in experiments.},

abstract = {We describe the results of a numerical investigation of the dynamics of breakup of streams of immiscible fluids in the confined geometry of a microfluidic T-junction. We identify three distinct regimes of formation of droplets: squeezing, dripping and jetting, providing a unifying picture of emulsification processes typical for microfluidic systems. The squeezing mechanism of breakup is particular to microfluidic systems, since the physical confinement of the fluids has pronounced effects on the interfacial dynamics. In this regime, the breakup process is driven chiefly by the buildup of pressure upstream of an emerging droplet and both the dynamics of breakup and the scaling of the sizes of droplets are influenced only very weakly by the value of the capillary number. The dripping regime, while apparently homologous to the unbounded case, is also significantly influenced by the constrained geometry; these effects modify the scaling law for the size of the droplets derived from the balance of interfacial and viscous stresses. Finally, the jetting regime sets in only at very high flow rates, or with low interfacial tension, i.e. higher values of the capillary number, similar to the unbounded case.},

We also quantify the fluctuations induced at different flow rates, using syringes of different diameters, and using different syringe pumps with different advancing distances per step. Our work provides a way to predict the frequency of the fluctuation that the driving syringe pump induces on a microfluidic system and suggests that syringe pumps can be a source of fluctuations in microfluidic flows, thus contributing to the polydispersity of the resulting droplets.},

We present here a pipette-and-play solution offering the possibility of manipulating simultane- ously 10 different disperse phases on a single layer device.

abstract = {Using a phase-field model to describe fluid/fluid interfacial dynamics and a lattice Boltzmann model to address hydrodynamics, two dimensional (2D) numerical simulations have been performed to understand the mechanisms of droplet formation in microfluidic T-juntion. Although 2D simulations may not capture underlying physics quantitatively, our findings will help to clarify controversial experimental observations and identify new physical mechanisms. We have systematically examined the influence of capillary number, flow rate ratio, viscosity ratio, and contact angle in the droplet generation process. We clearly observe that the transition from the squeezing regime to the dripping regime occurs at a critical capillary number of 0.018, which is independent of flow rate ratio, viscosity ratio, and contact angle. In the squeezing regime, the squeezing pressure plays a dominant role in the droplet breakup process, which arises when the emerging interface obstructs the main channel. The droplet size depends on both the capillary number and the flow rate ratio, but is independent of the viscosity ratio under completely hydrophobic wetting conditions. In the dripping regime, the droplet size will be significantly influenced by the viscosity ratio as well as the built-up squeezing pressure. When the capillary number increases, the droplet size becomes less dependent on the flow rate ratio. The contact angle also affects the droplet shape, size, and detachment point, especially at small capillary numbers. More hydrophobic wetting properties are expected to produce smaller droplets. Interestingly, the droplet size is dependent on the viscosity ratio in the squeezing regime for less hydrophobic wetting conditions.},

abstract = {Using a lattice Boltzmann multiphase model, three-dimensional numerical simulations have been performed to understand droplet formation in microfluidic cross-junctions at low capillary numbers. Flow regimes, consequence of interaction between two immiscible fluids, are found to be dependent on the capillary number and flow rates of the continuous and dispersed phases. A regime map is created to describe the transition from droplets formation at a cross-junction (DCJ), downstream of cross-junction to stable parallel flows. The influence of flow rate ratio, capillary number, and channel geometry is then systematically studied in the squeezing-pressure-dominated DCJ regime. The plug length is found to exhibit a linear dependence on the flow rate ratio and obey power-law behavior on the capillary number. The channel geometry plays an important role in droplet breakup process. A scaling model is proposed to predict the plug length in the DCJ regime with the fitting constants depending on the geometrical parameters.},

abstract = {Droplet based microfluidics is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field of research combining soft matter physics, biochemistry and microsystems engineering. Its applications range from fast analytical systems or the synthesis of advanced materials to protein crystallization and biological assays for living cells. Precise control of droplet volumes and reliable manipulation of individual droplets such as coalescence, mixing of their contents, and sorting in combination with fast analysis tools allow us to perform chemical reactions inside the droplets under defined conditions. In this paper, we will review available drop generation and manipulation techniques. The main focus of this review is not to be comprehensive and explain all techniques in great detail but to identify and shed light on similarities and underlying physical principles. Since geometry and wetting properties of the microfluidic channels are crucial factors for droplet generation, we also briefly describe typical device fabrication methods in droplet based microfluidics. Examples of applications and reaction schemes which rely on the discussed manipulation techniques are also presented, such as the fabrication of special materials and biophysical experiments.

abstract = {Fluids that are of interest in nature, biotechnology and chemistry are rarely either simple single-phase or non-confined (open system) fluids. It is therefore not surprising that recently a surge of interest has arisen in multiphase confined fluid manipulation. This paper aims at reviewing investigations into complex multiphase micro- and nanochannel flows. In the first part, the pumping principles for this type of flow will be discussed. These should be chosen carefully according to two factors: scaling behavior on the micro- and nanoscales and adaptability to multiphase coexistence in the same channel. Subsequently, multiphase fluid flow behavior in micro- and nanochannels is treated, which differs a lot from that in single-phase and non-confined fluidic systems. This behavior will include flow patterns, flow profiles, film flow, corner flow, and slip flow. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper describes a microfluidic chip for performing kinetic measurements with better than millisecond resolution. Rapid kinetic measurements in microfluidic systems are complicated by two problems: mixing is slow and dispersion is large. These problems also complicate biochemical assays performed in microfluidic chips. We have recently shown (Song, H.; Tice, J. D.; Ismagilov, R. F. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2003, 42, 768-772) how multiphase fluid flow in microchannels can be used to address both problems by transporting the reagents inside aqueous droplets (plugs) surrounded by an immiscible fluid. Here, this droplet-based microfluidic system was used to extract kinetic parameters of an enzymatic reaction. Rapid single-turnover kinetics of ribonuclease A (RNase A) was measured with better than millisecond resolution using sub-microliter volumes of solutions. To obtain the single-turnover rate constant (k = 1100 +/- 250 s(-1)), four new features for this microfluidics platform were demonstrated: (i) rapid on-chip dilution, (ii) multiple time range access, (iii) biocompatibility with RNase A, and (iv) explicit treatment of mixing for improving time resolution of the system. These features are discussed using kinetics of RNase A. From fluorescent images integrated for 2-4 s, each kinetic profile can be obtained using less than 150 nL of solutions of reagents because this system relies on chaotic advection inside moving droplets rather than on turbulence to achieve rapid mixing. Fabrication of these devices in PDMS is straightforward and no specialized equipment, except for a standard microscope with a CCD camera, is needed to run the experiments. This microfluidic platform could serve as an inexpensive and economical complement to stopped-flow methods for a broad range of time-resolved experiments and assays in chemistry and biochemistry.},

abstract = {In this work, we have systematically analyzed the scaling law of droplet formation by cross-flow shear method in T-junction microfluidic devices. The droplet formation mechanisms can be distinguished by the capillary number for the continuous phase (Ca c), which are the squeezing regime (Ca c {\textless} 0.002), dripping regime (0.01 {\textless} Ca c {\textless} 0.3), and the transient regime (0.002 {\textless} Ca c{\textless} 0.01). Three corresponding correlations have been suggested in the different range of Ca c. In the dripping regime, we developed a modified capillary number for the continuous phase (Ca c′) by considering the influence of growing droplet size on the continuous phase flow rate. And the modified model could predict droplet diameter more accurately. In the squeezing regime, the final plug length was contributed by the growth and 'squeeze' stages based on the observation of dynamic break-up process. In the transient regime, we firstly suggested a mathematical model by considering the influences of the above two mechanisms. The correlations should be very useful for the application of controlling droplet size in T-junction microfluidic devices. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2008.},

Microfluidic technologies afford higher levels of control over two-phase systems than is possible in macroscopic process equipment, opening avenues to controlled reactions as well as products having tightly controlled properties including emulsion size distribution. A review of recent progress in two-phase flows in microfluidic devices is presented. The fundamentals of two-phase flows including some important dimensionless numbers are firstly introduced, followed by a review of two-phase flow regimes in gas-liquid and liquid-liquid systems, focusing on microfluidic methods for controlling droplet formation and coalescence. Applications of two-phase microfluidic flows are briefly reviewed, including new approaches to the formation of well-defined complex emulsion which, like a Matryoshka doll, have structure within structure. The large number of recent publications reviewed in this paper highlights the tremendous interest in the fundamental study and use of controlled microfluidic two-phase flows, driven by the promise of highly controlled processes and new products having controlled complexity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},
