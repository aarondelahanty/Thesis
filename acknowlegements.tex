I would like to express my gratitude to Thomas Franke's group and their generosity of time, patience, and guidance. I would also like to thank the international community of University of Glasgow and the city of Glasgow as a whole for the inclusivity, openness, and willingness to accept any curious mind as its own. Let Glasgow Flourish.
