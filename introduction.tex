\chapter{Introduction}

This project can be divided into two primary objectives. First, a system is developed to control pneumatic pressure in reagent reservoirs and therefore fluid flow. Secondly, the developed device is put to use to characterize micro-droplet formation.

The thesis presented herein is to be divided accordingly. First the design, development, and characterization of the flow device is presented. Followed by a presentation of the background theory necessary to discuss droplet formation. Experimental observations are presented and discussed. Finally, a conclusion is presented that describes the major accomplishments and courses of further investigation.
